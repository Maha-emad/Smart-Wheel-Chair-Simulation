# Smart-Wheel-Chair-Simulation 

We create an angular web application that simulates a real-time  movement of a smart wheel chair . 

The application is divided into 3 modules :  
1) Control Pannel :
   Its a pannel where the chair operating and movement systems are controlled , 
   A) Speed and breaking subsystem : 
       -pre-define the constant speed of the chair  
       -controle the speed on going uphill and downhill as the application simulates the action of gyrometer                sensor that measure the angulare velocity and help in controlling speed where ,  
          
          a) righ angle, represents the normal state  of the straigh movment . 
          b) acute angle , represents going uphill 
          c) obtuse angle , represents going downhill
